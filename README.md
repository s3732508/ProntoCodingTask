# ProntoCodingTask
The repository is a Java Based Project created as part of a coding test conducted by Pronto.

# Sample Java Project

This is a Java based project which calculates Traversal distance between origin
and the moved cursor. This was created using Java, Eclipse and tested using Junit Libraries.
The requirements were part of the Coding task provided by Pronto Software. 

## Setup

Please Install Java and set the environement variables according to the following link

https://appuals.com/fix-javac-is-not-recognized-on-windows-10/

javac and java commands do not work with out environment variables set. 

###Execute the following Commands

####Enter the Folder src

cd ProntoCodingChallange\src

####Compilation:

javac Board.java 

####Running/Executiuon:

java Board

####Running Test Cases

javac -cp junit-platform-console-standalone-1.7.1-all.jar Piece.java Cell.java Board.java TestCases.java


java -jar junit-platform-console-standalone-1.7.1-all.jar -class-path . --scan-class-path


## Dependencies


## Bundles

The file 'junit-platform-console-standalone-1.7.1-all.jar' must be in the src folder. 

**##Features:**
1. Ability to create board of required size
2. Ability to print the board.
3. Structured classses which can be improved further if neeeded
4. Handled Exceptions
5. Calculate Traversal Distance
6. Heavy load Test Cases on the application with length given upto 90000


##Conclusion



Thank you for the opportunity.
